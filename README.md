- ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: The avatar is me as a young teen with my brother. I was test-driving a converted riding lawnmower that I repurposed as my gopher trapping transport rig. I was the owner/operator of this gopher trapping business and was compensated by the farmer/county to rid their hay fields of gophers. This really helped the farmers avoid extensive machinery damage while harvesting their hay crops. The addition of this rig to transport me to my gopher traps in the fields was a game changer. I no longer had to hustle on foot to each trap with my bucket of supplies. This was my first job and this experience reminds me to work smart and not hard.
