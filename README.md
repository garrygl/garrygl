- 😁 Fun fact: The avatar is me as a young teen with my brother. I was test-driving a converted riding lawnmower that I repurposed as a transport rig for gopher trapping. I was the owner/operator of this gopher trapping business where the farmer/county compensated me to clear the hay fields of gophers. This effort helped the farmers avoid extensive machinery damage when harvesting their hay crops. The addition of this rig for transportation to my gopher traps in the fields was a game changer! I no longer had to hustle, on foot, to each trap with my bucket of supplies. This was my first real job, and this experience reminds me to:
- 😉 "work smart and not hard."
