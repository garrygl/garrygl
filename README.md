- ğŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @garrygl
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Network Automation and my GNS3 playground
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Azure networking platform at an expert level
- ğŸ“« I can be reached at: skidrowing@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Fun fact: The avatar is me as a young teen (with my brother) operating a riding lawnmower I converted into a gopher trapping rig. It was my first job and reminds me to ignore the background noise and to keep working hard.
