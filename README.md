- ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: The avatar is me as a young teen with my brother. I was test-driving a converted riding lawnmower that I repurposed as my gopher trapping transport rig. I was the owner/operator of this gopher trapping business. I was compensated by the farmer and county to rid hay fields of gophers. This helped the farmers avoid extensive machinery damage when harvesting their hay crops. The addition of this rig for transportation to my gopher traps in the fields was a game changer for time and efficiency. I no longer had to hustle to each trap with my bucket of supplies. This was my first job and reminds me to work smart and not hard.
